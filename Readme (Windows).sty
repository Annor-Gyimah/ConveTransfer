ConveTransfer Software, Version 1.0.0
ConveTransfer was developed to facilitate the transfer of files from one PC to 
another PC without the need of a physical storage media or device such as a pendrive.
The name ConveTransfer speaks for itself as it allows users to send and receive 
files conveniently from anyone just because they have the software.
