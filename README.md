# Why use the ConveTransfer app?:
With all free and paid download manager why someone may need another one?
I believe that we have come of technological age where developers must find solutions to "small problems". I decided to make this desktop application because, I realize that most at times transferring files as it is so simple so to say sometimes can be hectic and frustrating especially when you don't owe a pendrive at the moment of transferring files from one PC to another. **"Secondly"**, some of these pendrives we use to transfer files are most infested with computer viruse that if care is not taken, one can corrupt his/her system. The need to always have a pendrive without computer virus attached is a necessity but it is not always guarranteed.
**"Also"**, the size of considering the USB ports some of these new laptops are coming out with especially those small portable laptops, most of them have USB ports that are very small and most of the pendrives are not able to be inserted in them properly without some force. No one wants to destroy their USB ports right? Yes that is what I thought. **"Moreover"**, when one is transferring files using a pendrive, they usually consider the size of it as in the total space of the pendrive. It will be frustrating if you are transferring 4 gigabyte of a file and your pendrive is only 2 gigabyte. I mean come on, LOL. **"Finally"**, who wouldn't want make things easier for them by just simple clicks. With just a few clicks, you just transfer files to another PC without first transferring it to a pendrive and then offloading it from the pendrive to the other PC.

# Disclaimer?:
Note that the ConveTransfer is not to desist the use of pendrives or other media but it has come to aid the transferring of files in a much convenient way where convenient here means that you dont posses a pendrive to transfer files at the moment so what do you do then? Conveniently, you find ways to achieve this file transfer and you can do it without the help of ConveTransfer.
